Font size - have a mix / man rem, then divide the sizes based on avg. weight

WIP max is bad on second element when first one has no percentage - now maybe fixed

TODO how to show difference between those that are in same unknownpercentage but we know one is bigger than the other?

Helmelk, kremfløte, 10 % sukker, modifiasaert stissvaelse (mais), stabilisator (johannesbrødkjernemel, guarkjernemel, karragenan), aroma, fargestoff (karotener)
and in this example, helmelk wil be 10-90
but more correct would be 10-80, because we know kremfløte is at least 10. Same for helmelk.

100 - (exact + SUm of all the minimums where no exact percentage is known) === undefinedPercentage
but this means we have to iterate through the list one more time
is there a better way?

Yes analyse v2
the intervals look  good
minimum on the interval is good
can set maybe maximum as well from previous min when available

afterwards the summing and the resetting of the ingredient max mins. when it works the initial minmax on ingredient level is unnecessary
